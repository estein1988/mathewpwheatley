Hello All, :wave:

I am a software engineer with a mechanical engineering background located in Seattle, WA. I love to work on projects which can combined and stretch all my skill sets. In my spare time I like to hike, run, climb, camp, take photographs/video to document travel, play with drones, woodwork with lasers and CNC.
